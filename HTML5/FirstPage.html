	<h1> What's Up World</h1>
	<main>
		<p>For starters my name is <strong>Mark Haynes</strong> and I am a UX/UI design student. I'm in the low-fi portion of my studies but I decided to get a jump-start and learn to code a little early. This is the beginning of my journey. Hopefully it emproves.</p>

		<p>As of now I am a student as Kenzie academy. I'm studying for the google IT support specialist certification on Coursea. To top it all off I'm learning to code on coursea as well.Yes my brain hurts but I hope it's worth it. I'll keep you all updated as I figure this all out.</p>

		<p>Today in coursea we made an <em>index page</em>. It honestly looks like this page. Atleast the same template as this page. She said this was a good chance for the student that haven't written any code yet. The only thing is i'd been coding along with her, if not more than her at this point in the course. Im trying to have as much content to work with when it comes times to really designing this page. I like to see my progress and this is the best way I can think to do this. Anyways I guess the point is that in this coding class, I didnt learn anything today. I'll let you know how the next lesson goes</p>

		<p>Now I am learning how to add pictures, images and icons like this.
			<br>
			<i class="fas fa-award"></i><br> <i class="fas fa-angry fa-lg"></i><br> <i class="fas fa-address-card fa-3x"></i>
			 <br>
			  In the course the teacher briefly went over how to add an image to our webpages. I know we use the img tag but not exactly sure where to get the images from. Im assuming from our computers or internet. Hopefully she teaches us both ways.
			  <br>
			  <img src="legs.jpeg" width="15%" alt="our legs on train"> I kinda learned how to add this picture on my own.
			  <br><hr>
			   Lets see is I can figure out how to add an image from the internet.<img src="snowwolf.jpeg" width="20%"> </p>

			   <p><strong>Hyperlinks</strong>This section is on how to make links. So this is an attempt to link to my LinkedIn
